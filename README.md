## Hello! 👋

I am a CS student passionate about GNU/LINUX and learning about computational mathematics, algorithmics and low-level programming.

I'm currently working in firefox/browser extensions and in a Software Engineering project which involves methods such as scrum, kanban and so.

Very interested also in online privacy, and in open-source projects as a replacement for nowadays closed source tools
